    %p This site was created by <a href="http://www.flyingmachinestudios.com">Daniel Higginbotham</a>. From this point on, he will be using the first person rather than the third.
    %p The reason I created this site is because I love design, and I wanted to share that love with other people. I want everyone to feel like design is accessible, because I believe it is.
    %p Communication is central to our lives as human beings. In creating this guide, I hope to help others communicate better. I hope that, in my own small way, I'm helping to improve the lives of others.
