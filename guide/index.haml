      .grid_16
        %p The people viewing your work want to answer questions like "Is this document the one I'm looking for?" and "What text explains this chart?" and "By what date is the ransom due?". Our brains automatically, unconsciously use visual cues in order to answer these questions. A clean design is one that makes it easy for brains to do this work. More abstractly, a clean design is well-organized and supports findability.

          %li
            %strong Finding actionable details.
            How do I get in touch?

        %h3 Visual Thinking
      .grid_16
        %p You convey ideas by the way you arrange a design's elements in relation to each other. These ideas are understood immediately, if not consciously, by the people viewing your designs. This is great if the visual relationships are obvious and accurate, but if they're not, your audience is going to get confused. They'll have to examine your work carefully, going back and forth between the different parts to make sure they understand.
        %p If you want to feel what this is like, try saying the colors of the words to the right. For example, for the first word you would say "yellow". Now, try saying the words themselves. (This works best in a public place, like a park bench or a coffee shop.)
        %p
          It's harder to say the color of each word than it is to say the word itself. Our brains automatically determine the semantic meaning of the word. This conflicts with the identification of the color of the word, a process which is not automatic. Our brains must then resolve the conflicting interpretations of the visual stimuli, a process which takes a little work. [cite

        %h3 The Most Important Thing to Remember (This is Very Important! Remember it!)
      .grid_16
        %p Your brain sees visual differences as meaningful. If there's not much of a difference, it's hard to tell if it's meaningful. That's what causes frustration! That's what makes people tear out their hair, crying "What the hell did she meeeeeeeean?!?!?!"        
      .grid_24.alpha.omega
        %h2 2. Contrast
      .grid_16
        %p
          You can use contrast to reveal a document's
          %strong organization
          and the
          %strong importance
          of its elements. Contrast also provides
          = succeed "," do
            %strong visual interest
          making a design more appealing to look at it.
      .grid_16
        %p
          In figuring out how a design is structured, our brains search for differences in the visual features of elements and attempts to assign meaning to these differences. There are a few basic visual features with which we can easily create contrast, including color, orientation, size, and shape.
          = succeed ";" do
            %strong The contrast among elements must be strong in order to actually convey information
          if the contrast is weak, you leave your audience wondering if the differences in presentation actually signify something.

      .grid_11.prefix_1
        %p
          A design is well organized when it's easy to identify its components and find specific content within it. Contrast provides organization by making the different components of a design stand out from one another.</>
        %p
          Take a look at the screen shot to the left, from the
          %a{:href => "http://www.alistapart.com"} A List Apart
          home page. You don't even need to be able to read the text to understand the page's organization.
        %p Because the headings contrast so strongly with the surrounding text &ndash; using size, color, and font &ndash; it's easy to identify each separate article.
        %p Clear contrast also distinguishes the main navigation, using a different background and font style to set it apart.
      .grid_24.alpha.omega
        %h3 2.2. Importance
      .grid_11
        %p You indicate an element is important by making it more noticeable. Making it larger, highlighting it, and giving it a different color all help an element stand out.
      .grid_11.prefix_1
        %p
          The important thing (pun! hoooo!) to note is that it's difficult to set one element apart as important if
          %em all
          elements are loudly vying for attention.

            In the flyer above, the most important elements stand out. This allows the document to be understood (
            %em> what is this for?
            ) quickly and re-navigated (
            %em> when are their regular classes?
            ) quickly.
        .grid_11.prefix_1
          %p On the web page above, you can get a sense of what the designer is trying to communicate but it takes work. It's hard to focus on anything because every other element is trying to grab your attention.
      .grid_24.alpha.omega
        .grid_23
          %p By the same token, you should make less important information less noticeable. It makes sense to clearly de-emphasize content like footnotes, captions, and citations. You don't want them competing with more important content for attention. At the same time, if they're easily distinguishable, you make it easy for your audience to direct their attention to them when they want. By accurately indicating importance, you allow your audience to use their attention efficiently and without frustration.
      .grid_24.alpha.omega
        %h3 2.3. Visual Interest
      .grid_16
        %p Accurately revealing organization and importance allows the audience to explore with confidence. They know they won't come across any unwelcome surprises. Like having an accurate map. That's just my guess, though.
      .grid_24.alpha.omega
        %h2 3. Proximity
      .grid_16
        %p Elements placed close to each other are seen as forming a group sharing a unifying concept. By grouping related content and visuals together you help the user quickly find the information he needs. To prevent confusion and frustration, group elements which are actually related. That sounds obvious, but it's easy to forget. Also, pay attention to spacing between elements - it's easy to space elements such that it's difficult to tell what's grouped with what.
      .grid_24.alpha.omega
        %h3 3.1. Grouping
      .grid_16
        %p In the same way that grocery stores organize their goods by aisle so that you don't have to walk haphazardly through the store hoping that maybe, just maybe, you'll be able to find the double fudge brownie mix today, using proximity deliberately allows your users to efficiently zero in on the information he needs.
      .grid_24.alpha.omega
        %h3 3.2. Relatedness
      .grid_16
        %p It seems obvious that you would want to group things together which are actually related. Often, though people just don't do that. I don't think this idea needs much more explanation, so I'll just leave you with some examples of nonsensical grouping as a kind of cautionary tale. Bewaaaaaare!

      .grid_16
        %p
          In the photos to the left, you have to actually read the captions in order to tell whether they apply to the photo above them or the one below.
          Now it’s much easier to tell which captions belong with which photos.
        %p You should leave much more whitespace between non-related elements than related elements in order to make the logical groupings visually clear.
      .grid_24.alpha.omega
        %h2 4. Alignment
      .grid_16
        %p Alignment is crucial to giving your designs a clean appearance and to conveying organization. Slight misalignments are confusing and look messy. On the other hand, positioning and element so that it’s clearly out of alignment is an effective way of making it stand out.
      .grid_24.alpha.omega

      .grid_16
        %p Often, people like yourself add extra lines, boxes, bullets and other visual hoo-ha in order to convey information that’s adequately conveyed with Contrast, Proximity and Alignment. Including this fluff makes your user’s brain work harder, as it has to figure out the significance of these elements.
