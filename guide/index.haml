You sometimes have a vague sense of what you want, but can't articulate it or make it come about; all you can do is point and cry. This guide will help you will help you communicate with conscious skill. It will show you how to create designs that are easy to understand and attractive.

        %h2 1. What is Clean Design?
        
        .grid_16
          %p Have a look at the two flyers below. Which one is more appealing to you? Which one looks cleaner?
        
      .grid_24.examples.alpha.omega
        .grid_12
          %img{:src => "_media/images/aikido-before.png"}/
        %img{:src => "_media/images/aikido-after.png"}/
        .clear
      
      .grid_16
        %p If the one on the right looks cleaner to you, then &ndash; hooray! I've done my job. But what does it <em>mean</em> to "look cleaner"?
      
      .grid_24.alpha.omega
        .grid_16
          %p Whatever you're creating &mdash; a brochure, a resume, a web page, a party invitation &mdash; the basic purpose it must serve is to convey the information your audience is interested in. It must help your audience answer questions like "Is this document the one I'm looking for?" and "What text explains this chart?" and "By what time is the ransom due?" For example, the aikido flyer helps people answer, "What's this about?" and "When is it?" and "Where is it?".
        .grid_6.prefix_1
          %img{:src => "_media/images/brains/ransom.png"}/
      .grid_16
        %p The two versions of the flyer provide the exact same information. The one on the right, however, makes it easier for people to find that information. Its visual structure more clearly reflects the structure of the content.
        %p That flyer is clean, then, because it helps you consume the information within it with less conscious effort. It's designed so that its visual qualities will be interpreted in a way that allows the brain's visual thinking capabilities to make correct assumptions about how the different bits of content are organized and what's important.
      .grid_24.alpha.omega
        .grid_16
          %p Visual thinking happens much more quickly than conscious, step-by-step logical thinking. For example, if you wanted to understand what the main ideas were from just the text of the aikido flyers, it would take much longer and be more tedious than it would to use even the "messy" flyer. You can see for yourself by looking at the text to the right.
          %p To answer the question "What is clean design?" most succinctly: a clean design is one that supports visual thinking so people can meet their informational needs with a minimum of conscious effort.

        %h3 1.1. Helping Meet Informational Needs
      .grid_16
        %p Whatever you're creating, people have the same basic informational needs when looking at your documents:
        %ol
          %li
            %strong Deciding relevance.
            Do I even care?
          %li
            %strong Getting an overview.
            What are the main ideas? What's most important?
          %li
            %strong Basic comprehension.
            What text explains this chart?
          %li
            %strong Retrieving buried details.
            I remember something about an orangutan... where was that?
          %li
            %strong Finding actionable details.
            How do I get in touch?
        %p The informational needs of a single person will usually evolve in roughly the order listed above. For example, if someone's looking at a brochure, his thought process might be something like:
        %ol
          %li I want to find a good phrenologist. Does this have info on phrenologists? Oh frabjous day! It does!
          %li What services do they provide? Are they certified? Are they local? My heavens &mdash; yes, yes, and yes!
          %li How do I get in touch? Oh goody, there's the phone number! I'll call when I get home.
          %li <em>(Later, at home)</em> Now where was that number...
      .grid_24.alpha.omega
        %h3 1.2. Supporting Visual Thinking
      .grid_16
        %p You convey ideas by the way you arrange a design's elements in relation to each other. These ideas are understood immediately, if not consciously, by the people viewing your designs. This is great if the visual relationships are obvious and accurate, but if they're not, your audience is going to get confused. They'll have to examine your work carefully, going back and forth between the different parts to make sure they understand.
        %p If you want to feel what this is like, try saying the colors of the words to the right. For example, for the first word you would say "yellow". Now, try saying the words themselves. Does your brain hurt yet?
        %p
          It's harder to say the color of each word than it is to say the word itself. Our brains automatically determine the semantic meaning of the word. This conflicts with the identification of the color of the word, a process which is not automatic. Our brains must then resolve the conflicting interpretations of the visual stimuli, a process which takes work. [cite

        %p When you're creating a document, you want to eliminate these conflicts between automatically perceived meaning and actual meaning. The rest of this guide is dedicated to doing just that by explaining three visual features: size, proximity, and alignment. It will also explain a valuable tool: elimination. But before that...

        %h3 1.3. The Most Important Thing to Remember
      .grid_16
        %p The basic cause of messy design is slight, unintentional differences among elements. Things which look the same are perceived as being logically related; things which look different are perceived as being different. Small differences between elements which aren't meant to signify anything end up confusing everyone.
      .grid_24.alpha.omega
        %h2 2. Contrast
      .grid_16
        %p
          You can use contrast to reveal a document's
          %strong organization
          and the
          %strong importance
          of its elements. Contrast also provides
          = succeed "," do
            %strong visual interest
          making a design more appealing to look at it.
      .grid_16
        %p
          In figuring out how a design is structured, our brains search for differences in the visual features of elements and attempts to assign meaning to these differences. There are a few basic visual features with which we can easily create contrast, including color, orientation, size, and shape.
          = succeed ";" do
            %strong The contrast among elements must be strong in order to actually convey information
          if the contrast is weak, you leave your audience wondering if the differences in presentation actually signify something.
      .grid_6.prefix_1
        %p

          %img{:src => "_media/images/contrast/alistapart-page-426.png"}/
      .grid_11.prefix_1
        %p
          A design is well organized when it's easy to identify its components and find specific content within it. Contrast provides organization by making the different components of a design stand out from one another.</>
        %p
          Take a look at the screen shot to the left, from the
          %a{:href => "http://www.alistapart.com"} A List Apart
          home page. You don't even need to be able to read the text to understand the page's organization.
        %p Because the headings contrast so strongly with the surrounding text &ndash; using size, color, and font &ndash; it's easy to identify each separate article.
        %p Clear contrast also distinguishes the main navigation, using a different background and font style to set it apart.
      .grid_24.alpha.omega
        %h3 2.2. Importance
      .grid_11
        %p You indicate an element is important by making it more noticeable. Making it larger, highlighting it, and giving it a different color all help an element stand out.
      .grid_11.prefix_1
        %p
          The important thing (pun! hoooo!) to note is that it's difficult to set one element apart as important if
          %em all
          elements are loudly vying for attention.
      .grid_24.alpha.omega
        .grid_11

        .grid_11
          %p
            In the flyer above, the most important elements stand out. This allows the document to be understood (
            %em> what is this for?
            ) quickly and re-navigated (
            %em> when are their regular classes?
            ) quickly.
        .grid_11.prefix_1
          %p On the web page above, you can get a sense of what the designer is trying to communicate but it takes work. It's hard to focus on anything because every other element is trying to grab your attention.
      .grid_24.alpha.omega
        .grid_23
          %p By the same token, you should make less important information less noticeable. It makes sense to clearly de-emphasize content like footnotes, captions, and citations. You don't want them competing with more important content for attention. At the same time, if they're easily distinguishable, you make it easy for your audience to direct their attention to them when they want. By accurately indicating importance, you allow your audience to use their attention efficiently and without frustration.
      .grid_24.alpha.omega
        %h3 2.3. Visual Interest
      .grid_16
        %p Accurately revealing organization and importance allows the audience to explore with confidence. They know they won't come across any unwelcome surprises. Like having an accurate map. That's just my guess, though.
      .grid_24.alpha.omega
        %h2 3. Proximity
      .grid_16
        %p Elements placed close to each other are seen as forming a group sharing a unifying concept. By grouping related content and visuals together you help the user quickly find the information he needs. To prevent confusion and frustration, group elements which are actually related. That sounds obvious, but it's easy to forget. Also, pay attention to spacing between elements - it's easy to space elements such that it's difficult to tell what's grouped with what.
      .grid_24.alpha.omega
        %h3 3.1. Grouping
      .grid_16
        %p In the same way that grocery stores organize their goods by aisle so that you don't have to walk haphazardly through the store hoping that maybe, just maybe, you'll be able to find the double fudge brownie mix today, using proximity deliberately allows your users to efficiently zero in on the information he needs.
      .grid_24.alpha.omega
        %h3 3.2. Relatedness
      .grid_16
        %p It seems obvious that you would want to group things together which are actually related. Often, though people just don't do that. I don't think this idea needs much more explanation, so I'll just leave you with some examples of nonsensical grouping as a kind of cautionary tale. Bewaaaaaare!
      .grid_24.alpha.omega
        %h3 3.3. Ambiguity and How to Avoid It
      .grid_16
        %p
          In the photos to the left, you have to actually read the captions in order to tell whether they apply to the photo above them or the one below.
          Now it’s much easier to tell which captions belong with which photos.
        %p You should leave much more whitespace between non-related elements than related elements in order to make the logical groupings visually clear.
      .grid_24.alpha.omega
        %h2 4. Alignment
      .grid_16
        %p Alignment is crucial to giving your designs a clean appearance and to conveying organization. Slight misalignments are confusing and look messy. On the other hand, positioning and element so that it’s clearly out of alignment is an effective way of making it stand out.
      .grid_24.alpha.omega
        %h3 4.1. Organization
      .grid_16
        %p Elements sharing alignment are seen as related.

        %h3 4.2. Cleanliness
      .grid_16
        %p Slight misalignments make for more work. Since they don't actually convey information, or rather, they convey misinformation, the result is an impression of messiness.
      .grid_24.alpha.omega
        %h3 4.3. Attention
      .grid_16
        %p You can make an element stand out by intentionally breaking alignment.
      .grid_24.alpha.omega
        %h2 5. Elimination
      .grid_16
        %p Often, people like yourself add extra lines, boxes, bullets and other visual hoo-ha in order to convey information that’s adequately conveyed with Contrast, Proximity and Alignment. Including this fluff makes your user’s brain work harder, as it has to figure out the significance of these elements.
