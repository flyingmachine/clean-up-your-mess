  <p>The main purpose of this guide is to help you create slides which are easier to understand. You convey ideas by the way you arrange a slide's elements in relation to each other. Visual relationships provide answers to questions like "What are the main ideas?" and "What are the supporting ideas?" and "what text explains this chart?"</p>

  <p>These ideas are understood immediately, if not consciously, by the people reading your slides. This is great if the visual relationships are obvious and accurate, but if they're not, your readers are going to get confused. They'll have to examine your slides carefully, going back and forth between the different parts, to make sure they understand. Even then they might not be sure. This kind of frustration is easily avoidable by using the visual design principles that follow.

  <p>If you're like most people, you're like a baby when it comes to visual design. You have an idea of what you want but you can't really articulate it or make it come about; all you can do is point and cry. This guide will help introduce you to the community of visual design adults. It will help you quickly see why a slide is confusing, and how to to fix it.<br />
