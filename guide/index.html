  			<p>If you're like most people, you're a baby when it comes to visual design. You have a vague sense of what you want but you can't articulate it or make it come about; all you can do is point and cry. This guide will help you become a visual design adult. It will help you quickly see why a design is confusing, and how to fix it. It will help you communicate with conscious skill.</p>

			<h4>1. Braaaaaaaaaaaains</h4>
		</div>

		<div class="grid_16">
		  <p>The people viewing your work want to answer questions like "Is this document the one I'm looking for?" and "What text explains this chart?" and "By what date is the ransom due?". Our brains automatically, unconsciously use visual cues in order to answer these questions. Visual design is about making it easy for brains to do this work.</p>

			<h5>1.1. Visual Thinking</h5>
		</div>
		<div class="grid_16">
			<p>You convey ideas by the way you arrange a design's elements in relation to each other. These ideas are understood immediately, if not consciously, by the people viewing your designs. This is great if the visual relationships are obvious and accurate, but if they're not, your audience is going to get confused. They'll have to examine your work carefully, going back and forth between the different parts to make sure they understand.</p>
			<p>If you want to feel what this is like, try saying the colors of the words to the right. For example, for the first word you would say "yellow". Now, try saying the words themselves. (This works best in a public place, like a park bench or a coffee shop.)</p>
			<p>It's harder to say the color of each word than it is to say the word itself. Our brains automatically determine the semantic meaning of the word. This conflicts with the identification of the color of the word, a process which is not automatic. Our brains must then resolve the conflicting interpretations of the visual stimuli, a process which takes a little work. [cite <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stroop_effect" title="Stroop effect - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia">stroop effect</a>]</p>
			<p>These are the kinds of conflicts you inflict upon your poor audiences' grey matter when you communicate visually without knowing what you're doing. Shame on you.</p>

			<h5>1.2. Informational Needs</h5>
		</div>
		<div class="grid_16">
		  <p>People have different informational needs when looking at your documents:</p>
		  <ol>
		    <li><strong>Deciding relevance.</strong> Is this even the right document?</li>
		    <li><strong>Getting an overview.</strong> What are the main ideas? What's most important?</li>
		    <li><strong>Basic comprehension.</strong> What text explains this chart?</li>
		    <li><strong>Retrieving buried details.</strong> I remember something about an orangutan... where was that?</li>
		    <li><strong>Finding actionable details.</strong> How do I get in touch?</li>
		  </ol>
		  <p>The informational needs of a single person will usually evolve in roughly the order listed above. Your designs should help your audience meet all the needs &mdash; or else!</p>
	  </div>
	   
		<div class="grid_24 alpha omega">
			<h4>2. Contrast</h4>
		</div>
		
		<div class="grid_16">
		  <p>You can use contrast to reveal a document's <strong>organization</strong> and the <strong>importance</strong> of its elements. Contrast also provides <strong>visual interest</strong>, making a design more appealing to look at it.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="grid_16">
		  <p>In figuring out how a design is structured, our brains search for differences in the visual features of elements and attempts to assign meaning to these differences. There are a few basic visual features with which we can easily create contrast, including color, orientation, size, and shape. <strong>The contrast among elements must be strong in order to actually convey information</strong>; if the contrast is weak, you leave your audience wondering if the differences in presentation actually signify something.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="grid_6 prefix_1">
      <p><img src="_media/images/contrast-circles.png" /></p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="grid_24 alpha omega">
			<h5>2.1. Organization</h5>
		</div>
    
    <div class="grid_11">
      <p><img src="_media/images/contrast/alistapart-page-426.png" /></p>
    </div>
	  <div class="grid_11 prefix_1">
	    <p>A design is well organized when it's easy to identify its components and find specific content within it. Contrast provides organization by making the different components of a design stand out from one another.</>
	    <p>Take a look at the screen shot to the left, from the <a href="http://www.alistapart.com">A List Apart</a> home page. You don't even need to be able to read the text to understand the page's organization.</p>
		  <p>Because the headings contrast so strongly with the surrounding text &ndash; using size, color, and font &ndash; it's easy to identify each separate article.</p>
		  <p>Clear contrast also distinguishes the main navigation, using a different background and font style to set it apart.</p>
	  </div>
    
    <div class="grid_24 alpha omega">
			<h5>2.2. Importance</h5>
		</div>
		<div class="grid_11">
			<p>You indicate an element is important by making it more noticeable. Making it larger, highlighting it, and giving it a different color all help an element stand out.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="grid_11 prefix_1">
		  <p>The important thing (pun! hoooo!) to note is that it's difficult to set one element apart as important if <em>all</em> elements are loudly vying for attention.</p>
	  </div>
	  <div class="grid_24 alpha omega">
		  <div class="grid_11">
		    <p><img src="_media/images/contrast/aikido.jpg" /></p>
		  </div>
		  <div class="grid_11 prefix_1">
		    <p><img src="_media/images/contrast/alexchiu.png" /></p>
		  </div>
	  </div>
	  <div class="grid_24 alpha omega">
		  <div class="grid_11">
  			<p>In the flyer above, the most important elements stand out. This allows the document to be understood (<em>what is this for?</em>) quickly and re-navigated (<em>when are their regular classes?</em>) quickly.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="grid_11 prefix_1">
			  <p>On the web page above, you can get a sense of what the designer is trying to communicate but it takes work. It's hard to focus on anything because every other element is trying to grab your attention.</p>
		  </div>
		</div>
	  <div class="grid_24 alpha omega">
	    <div class="grid_23">
	      <p>By the same token, you should make less important information less noticeable. It makes sense to clearly de-emphasize content like footnotes, captions, and citations. You don't want them competing with more important content for attention. At the same time, if they're easily distinguishable, you make it easy for your audience to direct their attention to them when they want. By accurately indicating importance, you allow your audience to use their attention efficiently and without frustration.</p>
	    </div>
	  </div>
		
		<div class="grid_24 alpha omega">
			<h5>2.3. Visual Interest</h5>
		</div>
		<div class="grid_16">
		  <p>Accurately revealing organization and importance allows the audience to explore with confidence. They know they won't come across any unwelcome surprises. Like having an accurate map. That's just my guess, though.</p>
		</div>
		
		<div class="grid_24 alpha omega">
			<h4>3. Proximity</h4>
		</div>
		<div class="grid_16">
		  <p>Elements placed close to each other are seen as forming a group sharing a unifying concept. By grouping related content and visuals together you help the user quickly find the information he needs. To prevent confusion and frustration, group elements which are actually related. That sounds obvious, but it's easy to forget. Also, pay attention to spacing between elements - it's easy to space elements such that it's difficult to tell what's grouped with what.</p>
	  </div>
		  
	  <div class="grid_24 alpha omega">
			<h5>3.1. Grouping</h5>
		</div>
		<div class="grid_16">
		  <p>In the same way that grocery stores organize their goods by aisle so that you don't have to walk haphazardly through the store hoping that maybe, just maybe, you'll be able to find the double fudge brownie mix today, using proximity deliberately allows your users to efficiently zero in on the information he needs.</p>
	  </div>
    <div class="grid_24 alpha omega">
			<h5>3.2. Relatedness</h5>
		</div>
		<div class="grid_16">
		  <p>It seems obvious that you would want to group things together which are actually related. Often, though people just don't do that. I don't think this idea needs much more explanation, so I'll just leave you with some examples of nonsensical grouping as a kind of cautionary tale. Bewaaaaaare!</p>
	  </div>
	  <div class="grid_24 alpha omega">
			<h5>3.2. Ambiguity and How to Avoid It</h5>
		</div>
		<div class="grid_16">
		  <p>In the photos to the left, you have to actually read the captions in order to tell whether they apply to the photo above them or the one below.
      Now it’s much easier to tell which captions belong with which photos.</p>
      <p>You should leave much more whitespace between non-related elements than related elements in order to make the logical groupings visually clear.</p>
