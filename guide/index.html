			<h3>Preface</h3>

		<div class="grid_11">
			<p>If you're like most people, you're a baby when it comes to visual design. You have a vague sense of what you want but you can't articulate it or make it come about; all you can do is point and cry. This guide will help you become a visual design adult. It will help you quickly see why a design is confusing, and how to to fix it. It will help you communicate with conscious skill.</p>

			<p>Beyond giving you practical tools, I hope this guide inspires you. One of my favorite quotes is, "I open my eyes and I see paradise." What a great gift vision is. What an incredible way to connect to the world around us and to each other. My hope is that this guide will allow you to communicate with a little more creativity and a little more control - and that you'll want to learn more.</p>

			<p>You convey ideas by the way you arrange a design's elements in relation to each other. Visual relationships provide answers to questions like "What are the main ideas?" and "What are the supporting ideas?" and "What text explains this chart?"</p>
			<p>These ideas are understood immediately, if not consciously, by the people viewing your designs. This is great if the visual relationships are obvious and accurate, but if they're not, your audience is going to get confused. They'll have to examine your work carefully, going back and forth between the different parts to make sure they understand. Even then they might not be sure.</p>
