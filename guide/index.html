  			<p>If you're like most people, you're a baby when it comes to visual design. You have a vague sense of what you want but you can't articulate it or make it come about; all you can do is point and cry. This guide will help you become a visual design adult. It will help you quickly see why a design is confusing, and how to to fix it. It will help you communicate with conscious skill.</p>

  			<p>Beyond giving you practical tools, I hope this guide inspires you. One of my favorite quotes is, "I open my eyes and I see paradise." What a great gift vision is. What an incredible way to connect to the world around us and to each other. My hope is that this guide will allow you to communicate with a little more creativity and a little more control &ndash; and that you'll want to learn more.</p>

		  <p>Good design utilizes the brain's visual thinking capabilities to support information-seeking behavior. Visual relationships help answer questions like, "Is this document the one I'm looking for?" and "What text explains this chart?" and "By what date is the ransom due?"</p>

			<h5>1.1. Visual Thinking</h5>
		</div>
		<div class="grid_16">
			<p>You convey ideas by the way you arrange a design's elements in relation to each other. These ideas are understood immediately, if not consciously, by the people viewing your designs. This is great if the visual relationships are obvious and accurate, but if they're not, your audience is going to get confused. They'll have to examine your work carefully, going back and forth between the different parts to make sure they understand.</p>
			<p>If you want to feel what this is like, try saying the colors of the words to the right. For example, for the first word you would say "yellow". Now, try saying the words themselves. (This works best in a public place, like a park bench or a coffee shop.)</p>
			<p>It's harder to say the color of each word than it is to say the word itself. Our brains automatically determine the semantic meaning of the word. This conflicts with the identification of the color of the word, a process which is not automatic. Our brains must then resolve the conflicting interpretations of the visual stimuli, a process which takes a little work. [cite <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stroop_effect" title="Stroop effect - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia">stroop effect</a>]</p>
			<p>These are the kinds of conflicts you inflict upon your poor audiences' grey matter when you communicate visually without knowing what you're doing. Now it's time to show you how to stop being such a terrible person.</p>

			<h4>2. Contrast</h4>
		</div>
		
		<div class="grid_16">
		  <p>You can use contrast to reveal a document's <strong>organization</strong> and the <strong>importance</strong> of its elements. Contrast also provides <strong>visual interest</strong>, making a design more appealing to look at it.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="grid_16">
		  <p>In figuring out how a design is structured, our brains search for differences in the visual features of elements and attempts to assign meaning to these differences. There are a few basic visual features with which we can easily create contrast, including color, orientation, size, and shape. <strong>The contrast among elements must be strong in order to actually convey information</strong>; if the contrast is weak, you leave your audience wondering if the differences in presentation actually signify something.</p>

	    <p>A design is well organized when it's easy to identify its components and find specific content within it. Contrast provides organization by making the different components of a design stand out from one another.</>

		  <p>Because the headings contrast so strongly with the surrounding text &ndash; using size, color, and font &ndash; it's easy to identify each separate article.</p>
		  <p>Clear contrast also distinguishes the main navigation, using a different background and font style to set it apart.</p>
