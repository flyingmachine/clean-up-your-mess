Size

Inherent meaning
* Size and importance
* Size and landmarks - organization
* what happens when everything is big
* what happens when everything is small
* what happens when the size differences don't mean anything

Just give examples of crappy versions and see what can be done to improve them?

any studies on findability based on size?
