Size

Inherent meaning
* Size and importance
* Size and landmarks - organization
* what happens when everything is big
* what happens when everything is small
* what happens when the size differences don't mean anything

Just give examples of crappy versions and see what can be done to improve them?

any studies on findability based on size?

What are the differences in how size is used in the two flyers? How do the sizes of the different elements compare to each other? How does this improve or detract from the understandability of the flyers?

The flyer on the right differs from the one on the left in two key ways. First, there is more regularity in its use of size. Second, the headings are much larger than the body text.

Remember that our brains try to assign meaning to visual differences. Why is this text bold? why is this text slightly smaller, but in all caps? Without any regularity, there's no way to compare, no way to assign meaning. Regularity gives you a "base state". The first flyer essentially has no regularity to size. This makes it impossible to scan quickly. It makes it impossible to differentiate the different kinds of content. Everything has to be given the same amount of attention.

The differences in size serves to differentiate. Large items also serve as visual landmarks. Because they stand out so much, it's easy for our eyes to find them when searching for useful content. Also makes the text easier to read from a distance. Makes the text easier to read.  Size communicates relative importance. Important to whom? Important to the person viewing your document.

What does the size of an element tell you about that element? How important is it? How does it help you in finding the information you want?

What are the main ideas?
- Size indicates importance
- Size functions as visual landmarks

Ok so how does size indicate importance. Bigger things are more important - why? You "contract" with the audience. The largest text will tell you most of what you need to know. Is any more explanation needed?

Size is used to direct attention. Help the user efficiently direct his attention

Have another look at the aikido flyers:

Size provides a hierarchy

Headings provide the main ideas
Making them larger makes them easier to find

One of the main differences is that the improved flyer uses consistent sizes for the text. There's also more contrast between the size header text and the size of the detail text.

Both of these differences help the user find information more easily by... using different roles.


The contrast in size makes it easier to identify header and detail text. Consistency... Why is it important to do that? It's important to do that because it helps the user navigate the information in your document more easily.

Headers and details are two informational roles. A header communicates "I'm the main idea of the information that follows." Detail text communicates, well, that you'll find details there.
---------------
There are two main differences in how size is used between the two flyers. First, the contrast between the header text and the details is much greater; the header text is much larger. Second, size is used more consistently. In the original flyer, there are slight changes in font size between one block of text and the next, and no two blocks look quite alike. For example, the block starting with "Please come and visit" is slightly smaller, but in all caps and bold. In the improved flyer, the size of the text is treated consistently.

These improvements serve to clearly reveal the roles of the different bits of text. The improved flyer makes it clear what's header text and what's detail text. Even if the text were in another language, you would be able to differentiate the headers from the details.

Making these roles visually obvious helps your users find the info they need. We rely on headers to help us get an idea of what the document's about. We also use them to narrow in on the details we're most interested in. At the same time, we know to pay less attention to headers when we're going through detail text. 

Using size to clearly distinguish the roles of the different bits of content helps users efficiently direct their attention. They know what to focus on and what to ignore, depending on what they're looking for.

Headers are like the signs at the ends of aisles in grocery stores - they let you know whether you want to go down that way. Details are like the delicious box of cake mix.
